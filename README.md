# Single Perceptron NN From Scratch

This repository contains a Python implementation of a single-layer perceptron neural network, built from scratch without external machine learning libraries. The perceptron learns a linear function (`y = 2x`) using gradient descent to minimize the mean squared error (MSE). Designed for educational purposes, this project demonstrates core machine learning concepts like weights, biases, loss functions, and optimization.

## Features
- Implements a single neuron with one input, a weight, and a bias.
- Uses numerical gradient approximation for simplicity, ideal for beginners.
- Trains on a small dataset to learn a linear relationship.
- Prints loss during training to visualize progress.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- NumPy (`pip install numpy`)
